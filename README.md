# Godot-Engine---Shooter
A project I made for beginners to discover a few basic things about the fantastic Game Engine Godot.

* The space ship shoots unlimeted bullets (one per klick). The bullet instances.
* You point where you want to shoot at and the space ship angle is set and it rotates.
* The enemy has fixed movement (up and down) and takes 10 hits before it dies.
* The player is stationary.
* Particle explosion when the enemy alien ship is destroyed.

This is for the absolute beginner programmer in Godot.
GDScript is the language used and Godot Version 3.2.3 is used.
You are free to use whatever you want from this project in your project.
